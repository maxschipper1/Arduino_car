# Arduino car

The goal of the project is to create a car model, steered by an Arduino. The arduino is going to control two DC motors in the back of the car connected to the wheels causing it to drive. The ardiuno i will also be connected to a servo-motor in order to control the steering. The servo motor will adjust the front axel causing the wheels to turn and lastly causing the car to turn. 

I will give the Arduino functions for the DC motors as well as the servo-motor and combining them to create a program for the car to follow. 
   The original plan was to call on these functions using bluetooth, making it possible to steer the car from your device. Unfortunatly the bluetooth side of the project was too advanced and the time was too little. 

I will build a frame using cardboard, wood and legos. I will then 3D-print the body for a more aesthetic look. 

**Components i will use:**
 * Arduino
 * DC-motors x2
 * Servo-motor
 * H-bridge
 * Breadboard
 * Wires
